# Installation Script Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Found in log.txt

Based on the installation log, several critical issues were identified that prevented the script from running successfully in OpenMandriva ROME.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Build Dependencies
**Problem**: Core build tools were not available when needed for compilation tasks.
**Solution**: Added early installation of essential build tools:
- `make`, `cmake`, `gcc`, `gcc-c++`
- `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`
- `python3-pip`, `flatpak`, `rust`, `cargo`, `stow`

### 2. Package Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Many packages in the original list had incorrect names for OpenMandriva repositories.
**Solution**: Created new `packages.txt` with corrected package names:
- `adwaita-icon` â†’ `adwaita-icon-theme`
- Removed packages not available in OM repos (brave-browser, docker-desktop, etc.)
- Updated package names to match OM naming conventions

### 3. Flatpak Not Configured
**Problem**: Flatpak applications failed because Flatpak wasn't installed or configured.
**Solution**: 
- Added Flatpak installation in build dependencies
- Added Flathub repository configuration
- Added command existence check before using flatpak

### 4. Python Command Issues
**Problem**: Script used `python` instead of `python3`
**Solution**: Changed all Python commands to use `python3` explicitly

### 5. RPM Dependencies Missing
**Problem**: Downloaded RPM packages failed due to missing dependencies
**Solution**: Added dependency installation before RPM installation:
- **Mailspring**: `libappindicator`, `gtk3`
- **Proton Pass**: `libXtst`, `gtk3`, `libdrm`, `mesa-libgbm`, `at-spi2-core`

### 6. Warp Terminal Download Issue
**Problem**: Download returned XML error instead of RPM file
**Solution**: Kept existing alternative download method with better error handling

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files:
- `install_test_1.sh` - Main installation script with all fixes applied

### New Files Created:
- `packages.txt` - Corrected package list with proper OpenMandriva package names
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This summary document

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Script continues on package failures instead of exiting
2. **Dependency Management**: Core dependencies installed early to prevent build failures  
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Package names corrected for OpenMandriva repositories
4. **Service Setup**: Proper Flatpak and system service configuration
5. **Robustness**: Added checks for command availability before execution

## Testing Recommendations

Before running the fixed script:

1. Ensure you have a fresh OpenMandriva ROME installation
2. Have internet connectivity for downloads
3. Have sudo privileges
4. Backup any existing dotfiles/configuration

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, the script should:
- Install build tools successfully before needing them
- Install most native packages from the corrected list
- Set up Flatpak and install Flatpak applications
- Install Cargo applications (if Rust/Cargo are available)
- Install Python applications via pip
- Handle RPM installations with better dependency resolution
- Complete build tasks for Git-based projects
- Apply dotfiles successfully

## Notes

Some packages may still fail to install if they're not available in OpenMandriva repositories, but the script will continue and complete the installation process for available packages.
