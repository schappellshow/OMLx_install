# Stow Structure Analysis

## **🐛 Problem Identified**

After running stow, config files are showing defaults instead of custom configurations from the stow repository.

## **🔧 Root Cause Analysis**

### **Possible Issues:**

1. **Incorrect Stow Structure**
   - Stow expects files to be organized by "package"
   - Each package should be in its own directory

2. **Wrong Stow Command**
   - The script runs `stow . --adopt` from the stow directory
   - This might not be the correct approach for your structure

3. **Adopt Flag Behavior**
   - `--adopt` moves existing files into the stow structure
   - If structure is wrong, files might be moved to wrong locations

## **📋 Expected Stow Structure**

### **Correct Structure:**
```
~/stow/
├── zsh/
│   └── .zshrc
├── git/
│   └── .gitconfig
├── vim/
│   └── .vimrc
└── etc/
```

### **Incorrect Structure:**
```
~/stow/
├── .zshrc
├── .gitconfig
└── .vimrc
```

## **🎯 What the Script Now Does**

### **Enhanced Stow Section:**
```bash
# List available stow packages
print_status "Available stow packages:"
ls -la . | grep "^d" | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v "^\.$" | grep -v "^\.\.$" || {
    print_warning "No stow packages found in directory"
}

# Try to stow all packages
stow . --adopt || {
    print_warning "Stow failed with --adopt, trying without..."
    stow . || {
        print_error "Failed to apply dotfiles with stow"
        print_warning "You may need to manually resolve conflicts in your dotfiles"
        print_warning "Continuing with remaining installations..."
    }
}
```

## **🔍 Diagnostic Steps**

### **1. Check Your Stow Structure:**
```bash
ls -la ~/stow/
```

### **2. Check What Stow Packages Are Available:**
The script will now show this automatically.

### **3. Manual Stow Test:**
```bash
cd ~/stow/
stow . --adopt --verbose
```

### **4. Check Symlinks:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.zshrc
ls -la ~/.gitconfig
```

## **✅ Potential Solutions**

### **If Structure is Wrong:**
1. **Reorganize your stow repository** to use package directories
2. **Or modify the stow command** to work with your current structure

### **If Structure is Correct:**
1. **Check if symlinks are created** properly
2. **Verify the adopt process** moved files correctly
3. **Check file permissions** and ownership

## **📝 Next Steps**

1. **Run the updated script** - it will show available stow packages
2. **Check the output** to see what packages are found
3. **Verify your stow structure** matches the expected format
4. **Test manual stow** if needed

## **🎯 Expected Results**

### **If Structure is Correct:**
```
[INFO] Available stow packages:
zsh
git
vim

[INFO] Applying dotfiles with stow (adopting existing files)...
[SUCCESS] Dotfiles applied successfully.
```

### **If Structure is Wrong:**
```
[INFO] Available stow packages:
[WARNING] No stow packages found in directory
[INFO] Applying dotfiles with stow (adopting existing files)...
[ERROR] Failed to apply dotfiles with stow
```

The script will now provide better diagnostics to help identify the issue! 🎉
