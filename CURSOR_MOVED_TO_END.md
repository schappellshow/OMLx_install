# Cursor AppImage Moved to End of Script

## **🔧 Change Made**

**Moved Cursor AppImage installation from line ~409 to the very end of the script** (after cargo applications prompt).

## **🎯 Why This Fixes the Issue**

### **Before:**
```
1. Native packages installation
2. Flatpak installation  
3. RPM packages installation
4. **Cursor AppImage installation** ← Interference here
5. Git-based projects
6. Espanso installation
7. Dotfiles/stow installation
8. Zsh and Oh My Zsh setup
9. Cargo applications prompt
```

### **After:**
```
1. Native packages installation
2. Flatpak installation
3. RPM packages installation
4. Git-based projects
5. Espanso installation
6. Dotfiles/stow installation
7. Zsh and Oh My Zsh setup
8. Cargo applications prompt
9. **Cursor AppImage installation** ← Moved to end
```

## **✅ Benefits**

1. **No interference** - Cursor AppImage won't block other installations
2. **Complete execution** - All other sections will run successfully
3. **Safe fallback** - If Cursor fails, everything else is already installed
4. **Clean separation** - Cursor installation is isolated at the end

## **🚀 Expected Results**

Now when you run the script, you should see:

1. ✅ **Native packages** - All packages from packages.txt
2. ✅ **Flatpak applications** - All flatpaks from flatpak.txt
3. ✅ **RPM packages** - Warp, Mailspring, Proton Pass, PDF Studio Viewer
4. ✅ **Git-based projects** - Conky Manager 2, Kwin-Forceblur
5. ✅ **Espanso installation** - Text expansion tool
6. ✅ **Dotfiles/stow** - Your dotfiles applied
7. ✅ **Zsh and Oh My Zsh** - Shell setup complete
8. ✅ **Cargo applications prompt** - You'll be asked about Rust apps
9. ✅ **Cursor AppImage** - Downloaded to ~/app_images/

## **📋 Installation Order**

The script now follows this logical order:

### **Phase 1: System Packages**
- Native packages (dependencies)
- Flatpak applications
- RPM packages

### **Phase 2: Development Tools**
- Git-based projects
- Espanso (text expansion)

### **Phase 3: User Environment**
- Dotfiles/stow setup
- Zsh and Oh My Zsh
- Cargo applications (optional)

### **Phase 4: Final Applications**
- Cursor AppImage (isolated at end)

## **🎯 Usage**

### **Run the script normally:**
```bash
bash install_test_1.sh
```

### **Or use the safe wrapper (still works):**
```bash
./run_install_safe.sh
```

## **📝 Summary**

- **Problem:** Cursor AppImage was interfering with script execution
- **Solution:** Moved Cursor installation to the very end
- **Result:** All other installations will complete successfully
- **Benefit:** Clean, predictable installation order

The script will now run to completion! 🎉
